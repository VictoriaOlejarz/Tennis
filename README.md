# Tennis

This simulation project in R models the scoring system and outcomes of a tennis match, which is based on a hierarchical structure of points, games, and sets. The game of tennis is unique in that a player's victory in a match is not solely determined by the total number of points won, but by how those points are distributed across games and sets. Players earn points by winning individual rallies, games by winning four points with a two-point margin, and sets by winning six games with at least a two-game lead, or through a tiebreaker if necessary. Matches are typically played in a best-of-three set format, although some tournaments, like men’s Grand Slams, use a best-of-five format.

This R simulation seeks to model the complex interactions and probabilities inherent in a tennis match, providing insights into how different strategies and outcomes at the point level can influence the overall match result. By simulating various match scenarios, the project aims to explore the statistical distribution of possible outcomes and the impact of player performance at different stages of the match.
